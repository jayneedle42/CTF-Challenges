I used the inspector tool to check the source code and found the flag in the body. 
<!--The password for natas1 is 0nzCigAq7t2iALyvU9xcHlYN4MlkIwlq →



Level 0 > Level 1

Instead of right-clicking, I used the browser menu to open Developer Tools.
I found the flag in the body of the html.
<!--The password for natas2 is TguMNxKo1DSa1tujBLuZJnDUlCcUAPlI →



Level 1 > Level 2

Right-click, Inspect, and scan the source code. 
I didn’t find the password in the source code, but I did find an image block linked to an image in the “file” directory. 
I entered http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/ into my browser
There I found a txt file. Inside it were usernames and passwords, including the flag.

This line made me think it had something to do with blocking search engines, so I check the robots.txt file.
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/
Search engines are not allowed to scan the /s3cr3t/ directory but that doesn’t mean I can access it manually.

In here I found another txt file with the flag.

Level 3 > Level 4

This level requires spoofing the HTTP referrer header
I opened up the terminal and used a curl command to spoof the header.
curl -u natas4:QryZXc2e0zahULdHrtHxzyYkj59kUxLQ \ -H "Referer: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/" \ http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
I found the flag within the returned source code.
Access granted. The password for natas5 is 0n35PkggAPm2zbEpOU802c0x0Msn1ToK

Level 4 > Level 5
